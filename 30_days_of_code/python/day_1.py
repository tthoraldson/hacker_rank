# Declare second integer, double, and String variables.
x = 0
y = 5.0
z = 'randomrandom'

# Read and save an integer, double, and String to your variables.
x = int(raw_input())
y = raw_input()
z = raw_input()

# Print the sum of both integer variables on a new line.
print i + x

# Print the sum of the double variables on a new line.
print float(y) + d

# Concatenate and print the String variables on a new line
# The 's' variable above should be printed first.
print s + z
